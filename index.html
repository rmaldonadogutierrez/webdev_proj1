      <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
      <p>Hi! I’m Regina Maldonado Gutierrez, a junior majoring in Applied Cyber and Information Technology Management. Dance has been a big part of my life for as long as I can remember, and this page is a little window into why I love it so much. 
	  I also included pages about my dream role @ Microsoft and a separate page with my resume, so you can get to know different sides of me.</p>

	  <h2>Why Cybersecurity?</h2>
      <p>I chose cybersecurity because I like solving problems and understanding how things work behind the scenes. With how much we all rely on technology, it feels meaningful to learn how to keep systems safe and prevent issues before they happen.</p>
	  <p>Through my classes, I’ve learned about things like risk management and digital forensics, which showed me how much goes into protecting information. For me, cybersecurity is really about helping people stay safe and keeping their information private.</p>

        <h2>My Dance Journey</h2>
        <ul>
		  <li>I'm Mexican American, and I've always wanted to connect to my Mexican heritage.</li>
          <li>I started dancing traditional Mexican Folkloric dancing in my sophomore year of high school.</li>
          <li>I quickly got the hang of it, and it soon became a passion of mine.</li>
          <li>During highschool, I got several opportunities to be an assistant dance teacher. I am now a mexican folkloric dance teacher in an elementary school in Little Village.</li>
          <li>I now dance in CICA, a non-profit organization that offers Mexican folkloric dance classes, music classes, and art classes.</li>
          <li>I am part of the main (adult) company, and we got invited to Argentina this fall to perform at a very well-known dance festival.</li>
        </ul>
