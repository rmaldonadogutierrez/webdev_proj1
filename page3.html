      <h1>My Dream Role at Microsoft</h1>
      <p>I aspire to work in cybersecurity at Microsoft, contributing to secure cloud infrastructure and threat detection systems. Microsoft’s scale and impact make it an ideal environment to grow as a security professional while making a meaningful difference. I’m especially drawn to roles that involve proactive defense, secure architecture design, and collaboration across global teams.</p>

        <h2>Why Microsoft?</h2>
        <p>Microsoft leads in innovation and security. Their commitment to ethical AI, zero-trust architecture, and global threat intelligence sets a high standard in the industry. I admire how they integrate security into every layer of their products, from Azure cloud services to endpoint protection in Windows. Their transparency in publishing threat reports and collaborating with governments and researchers shows a deep commitment to public trust.</p>
        <p>Beyond technology, Microsoft’s culture of inclusion, mentorship, and continuous learning aligns with my values. I’ve followed their cybersecurity blog and virtual events, and I’m inspired by how they support early-career professionals through internships and training programs.</p>
