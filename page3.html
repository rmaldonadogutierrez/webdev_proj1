      <h1>My Dream Role at Microsoft</h1>
      <p>I’ve always been interested in working in cybersecurity at Microsoft because it feels like a place where I could grow and actually make an impact. 
        I like the idea of helping keep systems safe and learning from people who are really good at what they do. Roles that focus on staying ahead of threats 
        and building secure systems are the ones that interest me the most.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Why Microsoft?</h2>
        <p>I’ve always seen Microsoft as a company that takes security seriously. They work on everything from cloud protection to everyday tools people use, and 
          I like how they focus on keeping things safe for everyone. I also appreciate how open they are about the work they do and how they share information with the public.</p>
        <p>Another thing that stands out to me is their culture. They support learning, growth, and teamwork, which is something I value. I’ve followed some of their cybersecurity talks and events, and it made me feel like it’s a place where I could learn a lot and be part of something meaningful.</p>

        <h2>My Vision</h2>
        <p>In the future, I want to help build tools and systems that make technology safer and easier for people to trust. I’m interested in learning how to design secure systems and understand threats before they become real problems.</p>
        <p>Long-term, I’d love to be part of a team that focuses on doing the right thing with technology—making sure it’s fair, safe, and helpful. I want to grow in a place where both the technical side and the human side matter.</p>
